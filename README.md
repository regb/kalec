#KALEC

This is the official repository for the Kalec project.
Kalec is a platform-RPG 2D video game. More info will be
available soon.

##Why using an archaic language like C++

This is a reasonnable question. Despite all its flaws and unexpected
features, I cannot really find any non-sound or non-consistant
language features. Certainly, we can contest the design principles
followed by C++, but at least it sticks to those decisions and
provide a consistant language. Unlike, for example, PHP were both
design principles and decision are horrendous, C++ chooses to place
control in the hand of the programmer and is well designed around
this (potentially bad) principle.

Additionally, low level library for graphics programming seemed much
more accessible in C++ than in Scala.

Finally, I wanted to write some relatively large program in C++, just
for the fun experience. I also want very little abstraction from the
machine, thus I try to only use only a few, and low level,
libraries.  Re-inventing the wheel is the best way to understand how
things work.

##Origin of the name

Kalec is the composition of Kale and C, Kale being the name of the
original project, which was renamed to kalec when moving from Scala
language to C++ language. The 'c' part is to refer to C++, altough
many people will complain that C and C++ are different languages,
kalec sounded better than kalecpp or kalec++.
